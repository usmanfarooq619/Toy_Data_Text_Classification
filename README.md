# Toy_Data_Text_Classification
We are comparing multiple approaches for text classification on toy dataset.

## Different Approaches that can be used
1. Words and Sequences
  - Rule-based System: To seperate text in organized set of handicraft linguistic rules
  - Machine System: To make a classification based on past observation from the data sets. Depends on Train and Test datasets and uses bag of words (frequency of words in a predefined dictionary of a word list) approach for features extension called. It invovles techniques like Na√Øve Bayer, SVM, and Deep Learning.
  - Hybrid System: A rule-based and machine Based approach
 
2. Vector Semantic:
Vector semantic defines semantic and interprets words meaning to explain features such as similar words and opposite words. Vector semantic divide the words in a multi-dimensional vector space

3. Word Embedding:
- Word2vec
- Doc2Vec

4. Probabilistic Language Model:
5. Sequence Labeling / POS Tagging:
6. [Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01026):
7. [GAN BERT](https://github.com/crux82/ganbert-pytorch):
